  <p class="center bb b--white-50 w-50 mt4"></p>
  <p class="center w-50 mt4">
    Even in the 'good' version of our app we have a couple of vulnerabilities.
    ZAP will not pick these up, but they are there - a good example of why you
    need to know a little about common issues, and not rely only on automated
    tools.
  </p>
  <p class="center w-50 mt4">
    In addition to these vulnerbailities, this version of the app will show some
    ZAP alerts if you scan it.
  </p>
  <p class="center w-50 mt4">
    These are 'Cookie No HttpOnly Flag' and 'Cookie without Secure Flag'.
    They relate to the 'sessionid' cookie on the log out page. They occur because
    when Django logs a user out, the sessionid cookie is replaced with an empty
    string, and has no flags set. This isn't a security problem (see the explanation
    <a href='https://stackoverflow.com/a/33787443' class='link dim'>here</a>).
  </p>
  <p class="center w-50 mt4">
    You may also come across alerts for SQL injection. We've tried our best to
    exploit this, but it seems to us it is a false positive. If you can figure
    it out, let us know!

        We've made several minor changes to the settings.py file, all of which

        On their own, each of these changes might not make a lot of difference.

        cross-site scripting and cross site request forgery, making it a little
        harder for an attacker to imitate a real user, or exfiltrate data once
        they accessed it.

        We also changed the SESSION_COOKIE_HTTPONLY to False.
        Changing this removed an extra layer of protection against cross site

        A malicious user could send a message to another user, containing a
